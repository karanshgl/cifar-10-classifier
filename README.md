# Image Classification
In this project, we'll classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).  The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. One will need a GPU to train the dataset
